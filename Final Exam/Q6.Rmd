    #need to condition expectation on only having 6 and 9 as options.
    C=dpois(6,lambda)+dpois(9,lambda)
    lambda = (sum(a)+length(b)*(6*dpois(6,lambda)+9*dpois(9,lambda))/C)/length(x)
    
    #check if the algorithm has converged

From doing the EM_algorithm, we get an estimate of about $\hat{\lambda}\approx 7.08776$. This is in line with what I expected since the mean of the data is about 6.74 and we'd expect to see something slightly higher than that with all the 9's converted to 6.
